## Hello, I'm Aamna!ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

I am a dedicated and motivated electrical engineer with a passion for electronics desugn, prototyping and testing.I believe that Digital IC design is my true calling, and I am particularly interested in RTL design for FPGA's and ASICs. I am also passionate to learn more about the IC design flow and physical design.
